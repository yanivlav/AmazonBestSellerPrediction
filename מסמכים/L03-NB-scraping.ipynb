    "The way we scraped information here also made the **assumption that HTML is generated consistently** based just on the URL. That is, unfortunately, less and less common, as websites adapt to browser types, resolutions, locales, but also as a lot of content is loaded dynamically e.g., via web-sockets. For example, many websites now auotmatically load more data once you scroll to the bottom of the page. These websites couldn't be scraped with our approach, instead, a browser-emulation approach, using e.g., [Selenium]() would be necessary. [Here is a tutorial](https://medium.com/the-andela-way/introduction-to-web-scraping-using-selenium-7ec377a8cf72) on how to do that. \n",
